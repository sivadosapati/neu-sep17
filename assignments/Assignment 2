	1. Write a java function to calculate the salary of an employee based on the following rules.
		i. function takes input of number of hours an employee worked and returns the salary.
		ii.  The first 36 hours worked are paid at a rate of 15.0, then the next 5 hours are paid at a rate of 15 * 1.5. Hours after that up to a max of 48 are paid at a rate of 15 * 2.
		
		Here is the prototype you can work with
		
		public double employeeSalary( double hours){
		
		*
		*
		*
		}

	2. Write a java function that adds all the digits of an integer until it is single digit.
		i. function takes an integer as input and returns its sum of digits.
		ii. for example input = 37, sum = 3+7 = 10, sum = 1+0 = 1. result = 1.

		Here is the prototype you can work with
	
		public int addDigits( int input){
		
		*
		*
		*
		}


	3. Write a java function to print all perfect number between 1 and n.
		i. Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
		ii. For example: 6 is the first perfect number, Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3. Sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

		Here is the prototype you can work with
	
		public void printPerfectNumbers( int n){
		
		*
		*
		*
		}
       4. Write a java class called pizza with (Add detail as needed) : 
              i. At least 3 attributes :pizza type and unit price and points for collection. More attributes are welcome to have. 
              ii. Constructor is needed. Extra-credit for 0.5 point if you write more than 1 right constructor for this class

       5. Write a java class called customer (Add detail as needed) : 
              i. Attributes needed: customer name and what pizzas customer has ordered. 
              ii. Think about what kind of data structure will be used to record the pizza name and numbers for each kind of pizza.( Give me your thought, Extra credit for 1 point)
              iii. In main method , sum up how many the customer spend. 



	// EXTRA CREDIT
	6. Write a Java program that generates an isosceles right angled triangle made of asterisks. 
		i. function should take input of one equal side as integer. Other than the edges the inner part of the triangle should be empty.
		ii. For example input is 6. the function should print—

	   Here is the prototype you can work with
	
		public void printIsoscelesTriangle( int n){
		
		*
		*
