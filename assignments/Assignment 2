		Here is the prototype you can work with
		
		public double employeeSalary( double hours){
		
		*
		*
		*
		}

	2. Write a java function that adds all the digits of an integer until it is single digit.
		i. function takes an integer as input and returns its sum of digits.
		ii. for example input = 37, sum = 3+7 = 10, sum = 1+0 = 1. result = 1.

		Here is the prototype you can work with
	
		public int addDigits( int input){
		
		*
		*
		*
		}


	3. Write a java function to print all perfect number between 1 and n.
		i. Perfect number is a positive integer which is equal to the sum of its proper positive divisors.
		ii. For example: 6 is the first perfect number, Proper divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3. Sum of its proper divisors = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.

		Here is the prototype you can work with
	
		public void printPerfectNumbers( int n){
		
		*
		*
		*
		}
       4. Write a java class called pizza with (Add detail as needed) : 
              i. Create atleast 3 attributes :pizza type , unit price and loyalty points. More attributes are welcome to have. 
              ii. Create constructors . Extra-credit of 0.5 point if you write more than 1 right constructor to this class

       5. Write a java class called customer (Add detail as needed) : 
              i. Create Attributes: customer name and which pizzas customer has ordered. 
              ii. Think about what kind of data structure can be used to record the pizza name and number of each kind of pizza.( Give me your thought, Extra credit of 1 point)
              iii. In main method , sum up how much money the customer spent. 



	// EXTRA CREDIT
	6. Write a Java program that generates an isosceles right angled triangle made of asterisks. 
		i. function should take input of one equal side as integer. Other than the edges the inner part of the triangle should be empty.
		ii. For example input is 6. the function should print—
