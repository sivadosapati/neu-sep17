Polymorphism
	- Method Overloading : Happens in the same class
		- Methods have a same name but different input parameters and same return types
	- Method Overriding : Happens in the child classes
		
<<Base class reference can point to child class object>>

Abstract classes
	- Base class whose objects can't be created
	- They are marked as abstract
	- They can have abstract methods
	
When you have a class and you believe that you can't create the object of this class - make it abstract


Interfaces

	- Interface is a special type of an abstract class that has only definitions of behaviors
	and no implementation. It is considered as a contract of an object
	- interface is a keyword that can be used instead of class when defining it
	- A class can implement multiple interfaces using implements keyword
	- A class should write code for all the methods defined in the interface
	- An interface reference can point to an object that is implementing this interface	
	
final keyword

	- final instance variables can't be changed once set
	- final methods can't be overriden
	- final classes can't be subclassed
	

static 
	
	- static fields are common data for all the objects of a particular class
	- static fields can be accessed by the class
	- static methods can be invoked by the class
	- static methods can't access non-static (aka instance) fields
	- non static methods can access static fields
	
packages

	- a logic way of grouping related classes in java
	- Create a folder for a package and define classes in that package
	- Make sure that the first line in the class has package <name_of_package>;
	- Classes defined in package can be imported into other package by using import <package_name>.class 
	- Classes defined in package can be imported into other package by using import <package_name>.*
	- java.lang package is available to all classes by default
	- default scoped variables or methods or classes can only be accessible by all the other classes in the package
